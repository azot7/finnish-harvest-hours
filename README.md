### TODO:  

- return all entries, and sum them up client side
- take the user's holidays into account
- display user name
- only render hours when the request is finished
- handle login and redirects properly
- calendar view for hours
- handle refresh tokens, currently need to re-login when the access token expires after 17h
- UX
- maybe replace the server with SUPERIOR HASKELL TECHNOLOGY
